# language-labs

Language Labs is a platform for connecting foreign language learners and facilitating conversations.

## Contributions
Initial work from Language Labs included a timer functionality for users to know which language to speak and also conversation starters based on interests

Additional features built by us: 
 1. Live translation of language known to language user wants to learn
 2. Text area for users to translate from language known to language to be learned
 3. Study storage, where anything submitted in our translator gets stored for future reference
